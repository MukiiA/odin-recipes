        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Rice is, without a doubt, one of my favorite food in the world. Not only is it my to-go dish when I need to prepare a quick meal, 
            but it can easily be turned into an elegant dish for special occasions. Pilau has a wonderful balance of flavors. It is a festive dish, 
            which is never missing during special occasions or events. It's made with rice cooked in a well-seasoned broth of Meat or chicken. Unlike the Indian pilau, the East African version does not use curry 
            and it's less spicy.</p>
        <p>Pilau is delicious on its own and can be served as a stand-alone meal, however, if you want a full Kenyan experience simply pair with Kachumbari,
            a cool and refreshing salad made with tomatoes, red onions, cilantro and a spicy pepper like serrano chili pepper. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>  
        <ul>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Pilau masala</li>
            <li>Cooking oil</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Cardamoms</li>
        </ul>  
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the onions to the sufuria and cook on low heat until brown. Keep in mind I have said brown not burnt</li>
            <li>Add the potatoes and then the garlic. I added my garlic at this point because it will cook better with the potatoes taking most of the bheat.</li>
            <li>Next add a couple of tablespoons of the freshly made pilau masala and the pre cooked beef. You can use chicken or mutton, but whichever meat you use, make sure it is pre-cooked.</li>
            
        </ol>
